## Finding Waldo

For ages, people around the world have been asking the question, "Where's Waldo?" As humans, we know Waldo from his glasses and a red and white striped shirt and hat. Even though Waldo has become an iconic image, "Where's Waldo?" puzzles are no easier to solve. They are well-designed to hide Waldo from the human eye. In our project, we attempt to find Waldo through a less traditional method. We will perform PCA analysis on images of the character, Waldo, from Whereâ€™s Waldo to identify whether or not a test image is a picture of Waldo.

Utilizing a dataset of colored images of Waldo, we will reduce the dimensionality of the vectorized images by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original image to reconstruct an image of Waldo in a smaller subspace. Once the eigenface is constructed using all of the principal components, we will be able to calculate the Euclidean distance between this constructed image and test images of both Waldo and non-Waldo projected into the same subspace to identify if the image is a picture of Waldo. The goal of this project is to elaborate on the topic of PCA that was discussed in class and present it in a fun and interactive way.
