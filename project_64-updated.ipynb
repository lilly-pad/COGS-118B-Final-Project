    "# Introduction\n",
    "In our project we will perform PCA analysis on images of the character Waldo from Where’s Waldo with the goal of identifying whether or not a test image is a picture of Waldo. Utilizing a dataset of black and white images of Waldo, we will reduce the dimensionality of the vectorized images by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original image in order to reconstruct an image of Waldo in a smaller subspace. Once the eigenface is constructed using x number of  principal components, we will be able to calculate the Euclidean distance between this constructed image and test images of both Waldo and non-Waldo projected into the same subspace in order to identify if the image is a picture of Waldo. The goal of this project is to elaborate on the topic of PCA that was discussed in class and present it in a fun and interactive way."

Once we create the eigenfaces for Waldo, we will follow the methods described in Liton Chandra Paul and Abdulla Al Sumam (2012) <a name=\"relatedwork\"></a> [1](#relatedwork) in order to calculate the distance between the eigenfaces of the test images and the eigenfaces of the training images when projected into the subspace."
