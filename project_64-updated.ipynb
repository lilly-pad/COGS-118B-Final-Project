    "# Introduction\n",
    "In our project, we will perform PCA analysis on images of the character, Waldo, from Where’s Waldo to identify whether or not a test image is a picture of Waldo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing a dataset of black and white images of Waldo, we will reduce the dimensionality of the vectorized images by calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original image to reconstruct an image of Waldo in a smaller subspace. Once the eigenface is constructed using x number of principal components, we will be able to calculate the Euclidean distance between this constructed image and test images of both Waldo and non-Waldo projected into the same subspace to identify if the image is a picture of Waldo. The goal of this project is to elaborate on the topic of PCA that was discussed in class and present it in a fun and interactive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is important because finding Waldo manually is extremely tricky and time-consuming, sometimes ranging. Therefore, this intuitive PCA method to automatically find Waldo is needed."

Once we create the eigenfaces for Waldo, we will follow the methods described in Liton Chandra Paul and Abdulla Al Sumam (2012) <a name=\"relatedwork\"></a> [1](#relatedwork) in order to calculate the distance between the eigenfaces of the test images and the eigenfaces of the training images when projected into the subspace."

    "# Methods\n",
    "Briefly, we collected 22 Waldo images, randomly vectorize 21 of them, and put these 21 vectors into a matrix. PCA will be done using these 21 images. The 22nd Waldo image will be used to test whether our eigenfaces can reconstruct this new image. Lastly, we tested our eigenfaces on a whole puzzle by breaking down the puzzle image to little square boxes and finding the box that has Waldo's face in it through reconstruction distance calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collecting images\n",
    "We collected images from various sources, including https://www.localguidesconnect.com/t5/General-Discussion/Alert-Answers-included-Waldo-Answers-if-you-guys-are-struggling/td-p/722677, https://petitefoxdesigns.wordpress.com/2015/11/05/wheres-waldo-wednesday-in-town/, https://github.com/wirooo/FolloWaldo, and so on. We whimsically selected some images from these websites, downloaded them, and manually croped them to a square where the tip of Waldo's right ear and Waldo's left cheekbone are roughly aligned at the same coordinates across cropped images. These images are named 1 to 22.jpg in `waldo_manual/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vectorizing Images\n",
    "Each manually cropped images that roughly align with each other are of different pixel sizes. So we used `myimage.resize((x, x))` to resize each image to the same dimension so that the column vector representation of each image has the same size. 21 of the 22 Waldo images are used to form the input matrix that will be used to generate our eigenfaces.\n",
